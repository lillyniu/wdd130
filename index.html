        <p>Hello, my name is Lilly & I am a mother of 2 wonderful kids & a wife to my handsome best friend. I am a
            medical CNA with 6 years experience in the dental field, an institute graduate & someone who also wanted to
            dabble into something else. So I chose software development. I love learning & enjoy acquiring skills that
            help me understand & appreiate the value in things. So here I am, learning how much more a simple web page
            deserves a little more respect for everything that it takes to actually build one.</p>

        <p>I am a resident of Salt Lake City, Utah. My mother is a descendant from the Kingdom of Tonga. Tonga is one of the first discovered of the friendly polynesian islands in the South Pacific. It's the last standing monarchy.</p>
